## Sparta Global Academy Homework- Restructure A website

## Project Review:##

### In this project I needed to reconfigure the css files to support the window size being manipulated. The task is complete when the page can be decreased to the size of a phone or small device and the information on the screen has been changed to allow a clear layout.

## Using CSS tools such as:
```css
.tile {display:inline-block;}

.tile {width:100%;}

@media screen and (max-width:600px;) {}
```

## Using these tools enabled me to change the properties of the shapes to created a layer without over-lapping items.
